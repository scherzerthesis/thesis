## Chapter Six: Future {.page_break_before}

## Preface
The broad purpose of this work was to better understand how BRAF^V600E^ tumors form and progress to lung adenocarcinoma.
Our strategy was (1) to determine additional tumor supressor genes in BRAF^V600E^ lung tumorigenesis, (2) evaluate effect different mutant-p53 alleles, and (3) profile the tumor cell heterogenity using scRNA-seq.
In this chapter, I will examine the exciting possibilities that arose as a consequence of my work. This will include a discussion on cooperating genetic events, p53 tumor supression, MAPK pathway targeted therapy,  and tumor heterogenity. 


##Future directions
immuno profiling?
