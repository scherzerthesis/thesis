Lung cancer is a global hazard on human health. The historic consumption of cigarette smoke has caused lung cancer to be the most common and deadly form of cancer. Fortunately, smoking-rates have decreased in the past 30 years with lung cancer rates also on the decline. However, even if cigarette consumption were eradicated, lung cancer would still significantly affect human health. Indeedm it is estimated that approximately 25% of all lung cancer cases arise in never smokers [@pmid:23714547]. Secondary causes of lung cancer include Radon exposure, high-heat cooking, family history, air pollution [@pmid:27174888]. An individual's risk of lung cancer also increases with age due to  decreases in the efficiency of tumor supressive mechanisms such as tumor immunity and apoptosis[@pmid:22974775].

Lung cancer can be broadly classified into two major histological categories that are named based on how the malignant cells look under a microscope: Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and Small Cell Lung Cancer (SCLC). Within NSCLC, tumors are further characterized based on histological structures, anatomical location, cell-of-origin, as well as genetic drivers[@pmid:18815398]. For example, lung adenocarcinoma is the most common subtype and is characterized by glandular and papillary structures while squamous cell lung carcinoma is characterized by keratin-pearls[@pmid:15059877]. Moreover, adenocarcinomas arise from alveolar-type-2 (AT2) cells in the distal lung and alveoli and are typified by genomic alterations throughout the MAPK pathway, such as EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, PI3K [@pmid:32747478; @pmid:11751630]. On the other hand, squamous cells carcinomas likely arise from basal cells and typically harbor SOX2 gene amplification [@pmid:27308419; @pmid:30332632].

The 5-year survival rate for patients with lung cancer was 25% in 2020 but varies depending on stage of disease at time of diagnosis [@doi:10.3322/caac.21654].Like other solid cancers, lung cancers are most deadly after primary tumors have metastaized to other organ systems like the liver, kidney, bone, or nervous system [@pmid:5130083]. Lung cancer patients with no local or distant metastasis typically have a 5-year survival percentage of approximately 40% compared to approximately 5% with distant metastasis[@pmid:27535389; 27740970]. Ultimately, the cause of death of many lung cancer patients include primary lung tumor burden, infection, pulmonary embolism or hemorrhage, or complications of metastatic dissemination[@pmid:23194048]. Although patient survival has improved  due to improved targeted and immune therapies, the still poor prognosis reflects a need to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying lung adenocarcinoma initiation, progression, maintenance and response to targeted- or immune-therapy.

The current standard of care for Lung adenocarcinoma patients are often a combination of several conventional chemotherapeutics including Cisplatin, Carboplatin, Paclitaxel, or Pemetrexed[@pmid:32548736]. Fortunately for patients who have been identified to have EGFR, ALK, ROS, TRK, or BRAF (V600E) genetic alternations are often offered pathway-targeted therapies[@pmid:27283860; @pmid:24651011]. As of late, many patients receive immunotherapy first, followed by pathway-targeted therapy after progression on immunotherapy. Furthermore, in the last seven years, exciting therapeutic options for _KRAS_ mutant lung cancer have been developed and tested, such as a combination of MEK-inhibition and autophagy-inhibtion, and direct inhibitors of _KRAS_ G12c and _KRAS_ G12D [@pmid:30833748; @pmid:35267628; @pmid:35167298]

**MAPK signaling in cancer** standard activation from the top of he MAPK pathway begins with extracellular ligands (EGF, NGF, etc.) binding to Receptor-Tyrosine Kinases (RTKs). This leads to an loading of RAS with GTP, which activates RAS. Many RAS mutations lead to either more efficient loading of GTP or less effciency GTP hydrolysis which both serve to activate RAS.  GTP-loaded RAS recruits and activates RAF kinases (ARAF, BRAF, CRAF) which then phosphorylates and activates MEK1/2 kinases which then phosphorylates and activates ERK1/2. This ultimately leads to the activation of a suite of cellular processes that are required for proliferation, differentiation, migration, and cell survival. Therefore, activating mutation in this pathway, from RTKs to kinases, serve to keep the pathway in a constitutively active state. For example, the most common mutation in _BRAF_ is V600E. This valine to glutamic acid substitution is located in the kinase domain and mimics phosphorylation, allowing BRAF(V600E) to become independet of upstream regulations like RAS. This active state drives many of the hallmarks of cancer that is required for tumor formation. It is important to note that oncogenic activation of the MAPK pathway differs from normal ligand-mediated pathway activation. For example, mitogens, such as EGF, only transiently activate the pathway even with constant ligand stimulation. This immediate and strong spike in pathway activation is integrated by various biological processes in the cell that results in transcription of certain target genes. In contrast, oncogenic signaling thru mutational activation of BRAF(V600E) results in constant kinase signaling that is integrated differently than normal pathway stimulation. Thus, an oncogene-specific transcriptional program is activated.

The importance of this pathway is reflected in the strong anti-tumor responses that are seen when small molecule inhibitors are used to target various molecules involved in the MAPK pathway. For example, Dabrafenib and Trametinib, inhibitors of BRAF and MEK kinases, respectfully, are used in patients that harbor BRAF(V600E) melanomas and lung cancers[@pmid:34455067; @pmid:25399551]. Although there is strong pre-clinical and clinical evidence that BRAF+MEK blockade can lead to tumor regression, not all patients respond to treatment[@pmid:35033867]. Therefore, to see a complete response, multiple pathways need to be targeted, such as PI3K or autophagy [@pmid:25472943; @pmid:32933997; @pmid:30833748].


Great effort has elucidated the proto-oncogenes that drive cancer formation when mutated, such as _MYC_, _RAS_, _PI3K_, and others. Yet we still do not fully understand the mechanistic details that determine how genes cooperate to drive cancer.

**Genetically-engineered mouse models **Genetically-Engineered mouse models (GEMMs) of human cancer have allowed for the reproducible analysis of cancer biology driven by specific mutations frequently found in cancer patients. These models are helpful in understanding the molecular mechanisms that drive tumor formation and testing tumor responses to targeted or immune therapies. Early mouse models were not engineered but instead selected inbred mouse strains that were natural hosts of tumor transplantation[@pmid:692142]. However, these models suffer from long latencies, incomplete pentrance, and often not relevant to human cancers. Therefore, carcinogen-induced models such as UV, Urethane, radiation, cigarette consumption, or MNU treatment models were developed to ressemble carinogene-induced human cancers[@pmid:7987394; @pmid:25363767].After techniques were developed to genetically manipulate embryonic stem-cells came the ability to engineer mice with specific mutations that could drive tumor formation. Since genes involved in cancer are also important for normal mouse development, conditional gene manipulation was developed to allow for temporal control.

The most commonly used conditional gene expression system relies on inducible transcription factors, such as tetracycline-dependent regulatory system, where the treatment of mice with doxycycline toggles gene transcriptial levels of transgenes. More recently, Cre-Lox recombination strategies have been utilized to get more cell type specific control. In this system, genes of interested are constructed to contain LoxP-sites that flank a particular genetic element and upon delivery of Cre-recombinase the DNA sequence in between LoxP sites are excised. With this approach, one can knockout a gene by engineering LoxP sites around critical exons, or one could induce gene transcription by flanking a strong stop signal such as a polyadenylation sequence upstream of a gene-of-interest sequence such as KRAS(G12D)[@pmid:11751630].

Genetically engineered mouse models of human cancer are important preclinical models, because they resemble the physiological environment of tumor growth in which tumors arise as progeny from a single initiating cell. These tumors can approximate the genetic alterations, transcriptional landscape, histology, and responsive disposition or lack therefore, seen in human cancers(cite). However, these model often take months to develop tumors and compound genetic alterations take time to develop. Later in this thesis, we will utilize TUBA-SEQ to both quantify tumor burden and cooperation of BRAF(V600E) with other common alterations in lung cancer.

Due to the robust connection between lung adenocarcinomas and mutational activation of genes involved in the MAPK-pathway, such as _EGFR_, _KRAS_, and _BRAF_,  many labs have generated genetically-engineered mouse models (GEMMs) that harbor conditionally-activated  cancer specific mutant alleles of either  EGFR (L858R), KRAS (G12D), or BRAF(V600E).

Our lab has previously developed a conditional mouse model of BRAF (V600E) human lung cancers[@pmid:17299132; @pmid:26001956; @pmid:31452510]. In the _Braf(CAT)_ model, normal BRAF is expressed from a conditional allele prior to Cre-mediated recombination . LoxP sites flank human _BRAF_ cDNA encoding normal _BRAF_ exons 15-18. Downstream of the LoxP sites is the mutant exon 15 that encodes the murine equivalent of the T1799A mutation that gives rise to the BRAF (V600E) onco-protein. Downstream of the mutant exon there is a P2A element and a CAAX-tagged _TdTomato_. Therefore, after Cre-mediated recombination, the BRAF (V600E) oncoprotein and fluorophore TdTomato is expressed at normal levels[@pmid:31452510].

**BRAF (V600E) signaling and cooperating genetic events to LUAD initiation and progression**  Mutational activation of the MAPK pathway forms lung tumors in mice. specifically, expression of BRAF (V600E) in the Surfactant-Protein C expression cells (alveolar type 2 pneumocytes) elicits benign tumor formation that fails to progress to lung adenocarcinoma. It is hypothesized that the cell cycle arrest is dependent on the tumor suppressors P53 and CDKN2A. Loss of either P53 or CDKN2A allows tumors to progress to malignant and deadly lung adenocarcinoma. Also, activation of WNT signaling and PI3K signaling similarly allows BRAF (V600E) adenomas to progress to adenocarcinoma [@pmid:31452510; @pmid:26567140; @pmid:24589553]. These observations are in concordance to the &quot;multiple-hit&quot; hypothesis that states that cancers do not arise from single mutagenic events, but are the consequence of sequential assaults on the genome that activate more than one oncogenic pathway. These multiple genetic hits allow cells to adopt traits to form cancer, which is coined by Bob Weinberg and Douglas Hanahan as the &quot;Hallmarks of Cancer&quot; [@pmid:21376230; @pmid:35022204]. The traits include suppression of apoptosis, active proliferation, altered metabolism, changes in cell identity, and forming blood-vessels to supply tumor cells with adequate resources for growth[@pmid:35022204]. BRAF(V600E) expression alone is sufficient to activate many of the hallmarks of cancer but additional pathways need to be activated, or suppresed, to develop to malignant tumors. Great effort has elucidated the proto-oncogenes that drive cancer formation when mutated, such as _MYC_, _RAS_, _PI3K_, and others. Yet we still do not fully understand the mechanistic details that determine how genes cooperate to overide tumor suppressive mechanisms and drive cancer progression.

**P53- mediated tumor suppression**
Cancers pose an evoltionary challenge for organisms regardless of their life span.  Therefore, supression of the outgrowth of neoplastic cells is built into many organisms. One such mechanism is the engagment of the p53 pathway. At the time of writing this dissertation, there are approximately 105,000 manuscripts on PUBMED that mention P53. P53 is so well studied because of both its apparent role in tumor suppression, but also because it is the most frequently altered gene in human cancer.

The p53 protein was originally discovered as a protein that bound large T antigene of the SV40 virus in infected cells [@pmid:222475].P53 is a transcriptional factor that has a DNA-binding domain that specifically recognizes two decameric half-sites. P53 also contains two N-terminal transactivation domains and a C-terminal oligomerization domain that are critical for P53-target gene activation[@pmid:16575405]. Central to the ability of P53 to induce transcriptional activation is tetramerization. Thus, if one or more P53 proteins in the complex is compromised in transactivation or DNA binding, transcriptional activity is compromised. Therefore, if one copy of P53 is mutated, the organism's ability to suppress tumor formation is compromised.

The importance of p53 is best demonstrated in people, and in mice, that have just one mutated copy of P53. In humans with the familial- inherited Li-Fraumeni syndrome, in which they have one or more mutations in p53 are almost certain to develop cancer early on and throughout their life[@pmid:3409256]. Similarly, mice lacking two function P53 genes are prone to leukemias and lymphomas and have a shortened lifespan due to cancer incidence[@pmid:1552940]. On the other hand, organisms such as the african and asian elephants, which have an abnormally low level of cancer incidence, have been shown to higher multiple copies of _TP53_ in their genomes[@pmid:26447779]. 

The most well-known cellular functions of P53 include its ability to induce cell-cycle arrest in response to DNA damage[@pmid:8242752]. Many stress signals, including oncogene activation has been shown to stimulate a reversible or irreversible cell cycle arrest[@pmid:9765202; @pmid:34812139]. However, the strength of P53 induced cell cycle arrest or apoptosis is likely cell type- and cellular stress- specific and is a active area of p53 research.

Once a cell encounters a stressor such as DNA damage or oncogene activation, P53 is stabilized and accumulates in the nucleus to activate a suite of target genes that can lead to a number of cellular phenotypes, such as cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis.

P53 was originally thought to be an oncogene as P53 is accumulated in lung cancer, which is not common in normal tissues[@pmid:1969059; @pmid:1694291]. Moreover, ectopic expression of a P53 cDNA was found to aide in the transformation of primary cells induced by RAS. However, early studies erroneously used mutated P53 instead of wild-type leading to the misclassification of P53 as an oncogene. We now know P53 suppresses cell growth and transformation[@pmid:19776744].

Often times, P53 is mutated in the DNA-binding domain at sites commonly referred to as &quot;hotspots&quot; due to there extraordinary frequency. These hotspot mutations poison the ability of p53 to bind DNA therefore blocking its function. Interestingly, since one mutated P53 can disrupt the entire P53 tetramer complex, a single mutation can exert dominant-negative effects by inhibiting the normal tumor suppressive functions of P53. Although one mutant P53 allele is enough to compromised transcriptional activity, there is still selective pressure to lose the other wild -type copy. Loss of hemizygosity implies there is still residual tumor suppression in the presence of a wild-type P53 allele[@pmid:27585860].

Early on in P53 studies, there were reports of certain P53 mutations having a &quot;gain-of-function&quot; (GOF) effect. For example, Li-Fraumeni patients with certain missense mutations in P53 would develop tumors earlier than Li-Fraumeni patients with loss-of-function (LOF) mutations [@pmid:18511570]. Furthermore, there were experimental cell biology studies that would express mutant-p53 in P53-null cells and demonstrate enhanced tumorigenic potential [@pmid:32404993]. Further evidence for GOF mutant-P53 in mice indicated that missense mutant P53 induced different cancer types and enhanced metastasis than LOF P53 [@pmid:15607980]. Furthermore, many groups have shown mutant-p53 can alter signal transduction affecting chemoresistance and altering metabolism.

The cellular mechanisms that GOF P53 are involved in are also well-characterized but context-dependent. For example, in Pancreatic cancers driven by KRAS(G12D) Mutant P3 interacts with CREB to induce FOXA1 transcription which enhances Beta-Catenin signaling to augment liver metastasis [@pmid:33839689].
