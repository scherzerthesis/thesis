    "abstract": "The p53 protein is related by sequence homology and function to the products of two other genes, p63 and p73, that each encode several isoforms. We and others have discovered previously that certain tumor-derived mutants of p53 can associate and inhibit transcriptional activation by the alpha and beta isoforms of p73. In this study we have extended these observations to show that in transfected cells a number of mutant p53 proteins could bind and down-regulate several isoforms not only of p73 (p73 alpha, -beta, -gamma, and -delta) but also of p63 (p63 alpha and -gamma; Delta Np63 alpha and -gamma). Moreover, a correlation existed between the efficiency of p53 binding and the inhibition of p63 or p73 function. We also found that wild-type p63 and p73 interact efficiently with each other when coexpressed in mammalian cells. The interaction between p53 mutants and p63 or p73 was confirmed in a physiological setting by examining tumor cell lines that endogenously express these proteins. We also demonstrated that purified p53 and p73 proteins interact directly and that the p53 core domain, but not the tetramerization domain, mediates this interaction. Using a monoclonal antibody (PAb240) that recognizes an epitope within the core domain of a subset of p53 mutants, we found a correlation between the ability of p53 proteins to be immunoprecipitated by this antibody and their ability to interact with p73 or p63 in vitro and in transfected cells. Based on these results and those of others, we propose that interactions between the members of the p53 family are likely to be widespread and may account in some cases for the ability of tumor-derived p53 mutants to promote tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "Inheritance of one defective BRCA2 allele predisposes humans to breast cancer. To establish a mouse model for BRCA2-associated breast cancer, we generated mouse conditional mutants with BRCA2 and/or p53 inactivated in various epithelial tissues, including mammary-gland epithelium. Although no tumors arose in mice carrying conditional Brca2 alleles, mammary and skin tumors developed frequently in females carrying conditional Brca2 and Trp53 alleles. The presence of one wildtype Brca2 allele resulted in a markedly delayed tumor formation; loss of the wildtype Brca2 allele occurred in a subset of these tumors. Our results show that inactivation of BRCA2 and of p53 combine to mediate mammary tumorigenesis, and indicate that disruption of the p53 pathway is pivotal in BRCA2-associated breast cancer.",

    "abstract": "Adenocarcinoma of the lung is the most common form of lung cancer, but the cell of origin and the stages of progression of this tumor type are not well understood. We have developed a new model of lung adenocarcinoma in mice harboring a conditionally activatable allele of oncogenic K-ras. Here we show that the use of a recombinant adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase (AdenoCre) to induce K-ras G12D expression in the lungs of mice allows control of the timing and multiplicity of tumor initiation. Through the ability to synchronize tumor initiation in these mice, we have been able to characterize the stages of tumor progression. Of particular significance, this system has led to the identification of a new cell type contributing to the development of pulmonary adenocarcinoma.",

    "abstract": "Rapid advances in generating new mouse genetic models for lung neoplasia provide a continuous challenge for pathologists and investigators. Frequently, phenotypes of new models either have no precedents or are arbitrarily attributed according to incongruent human and mouse classifications. Thus, comparative characterization and validation of novel models can be difficult. To address these issues, a series of discussions was initiated by a panel of human, veterinary, and experimental pathologists during the Mouse Models of Human Cancers Consortium (NIH/National Cancer Institute) workshop on mouse models of lung cancer held in Boston on June 20-22, 2001. The panel performed a comparative evaluation of 78 cases of mouse and human lung proliferative lesions, and recommended development of a new practical classification scheme that would (a) allow easier comparison between human and mouse lung neoplasms, (b) accommodate newly emerging mouse neoplasms, and (c) address the interpretation of benign and preinvasive lesions of the mouse lung. Subsequent discussions with additional experts in pulmonary pathology resulted in the current proposal of a new classification. It is anticipated that this classification, as well as the complementary digital atlas of virtual histological slides, will help investigators and pathologists in their characterization of new mouse models, as well as stimulate further research aimed at a better understanding of proliferative lesions of the lung.",

    "abstract": "Human tumorigenesis is associated with the accumulation of mutations both in oncogenes and in tumour suppressor genes. But in no common adult cancer have the mutations that are critical in the early stages of the tumorigenic process been defined. We have attempted to determine if mutations of the APC gene play such a role in human colorectal tumours, which evolve from small benign tumours (adenomas) to larger malignant tumours (carcinomas) over the course of several decades. Here we report that sequence analysis of 41 colorectal tumours revealed that the majority of colorectal carcinomas (60%) and adenomas (63%) contained a mutated APC gene. Furthermore, the APC gene met two criteria of importance for tumour initiation. First, mutations of this gene were found in the earliest tumours that could be analysed, including adenomas as small as 0.5 cm in diameter. Second, the frequency of such mutations remained constant as tumours progressed from benign to malignant stages. These data provide strong evidence that mutations of the APC gene play a major role in the early development of colorectal neoplasms.",

To investigate the role of the p53 gene in mammalian development and tumorigenesis, a null mutation was introduced into the gene by homologous recombination in murine embryonic stem cells. Mice homozygous for the null allele appear normal but are prone to the spontaneous development of a variety of neoplasms by 6 months of age. These observations indicate that a normal p53 gene is dispensable for embryonic development, that its absence predisposes the animal to neoplastic disease, and that an oncogenic mutant form of p53 is not obligatory for the genesis of many types of tumours.",

    "abstract": "The p53 tumor suppressor gene is commonly altered in human tumors, predominantly through missense mutations that result in accumulation of mutant p53 protein. These mutations may confer dominant-negative or gain-of-function properties to p53. To ascertain the physiological effects of p53 point mutation, the structural mutant p53R172H and the contact mutant p53R270H (codons 175 and 273 in humans) were engineered into the endogenous p53 locus in mice. p53R270H/+ and p53R172H/+ mice are models of Li-Fraumeni Syndrome; they developed allele-specific tumor spectra distinct from p53+/- mice. In addition, p53R270H/- and p53R172H/- mice developed novel tumors compared to p53-/- mice, including a variety of carcinomas and more frequent endothelial tumors. Dominant effects that varied by allele and function were observed in primary cells derived from p53R270H/+ and p53R172H/+ mice. These results demonstrate that point mutant p53 alleles expressed under physiological control have enhanced oncogenic potential beyond the simple loss of p53 function.",

    "abstract": "Individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome carry inherited mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor gene and are predisposed to tumor development. To examine the mechanistic nature of these p53 missense mutations, we generated mice harboring a G-to-A substitution at nucleotide 515 of p53 (p53+/515A) corresponding to the p53R175H hot spot mutation in human cancers. Although p53+/515A mice display a similar tumor spectrum and survival curve as p53+/- mice, tumors from p53+/515A mice metastasized with high frequency. Correspondingly, the embryonic fibroblasts from the p53515A/515A mutant mice displayed enhanced cell proliferation, DNA synthesis, and transformation potential. The disruption of p63 and p73 in p53-/- cells increased transformation capacity and reinitiated DNA synthesis to levels observed in p53515A/515A cells. Additionally, p63 and p73 were functionally inactivated in p53515A cells. These results provide in vivo validation for the gain-of-function properties of certain p53 missense mutations and suggest a mechanistic basis for these phenotypes.",

    "abstract": "The Arf tumor suppressor protein inhibits cell proliferation through both p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms. Two rat monoclonal antibodies raised against a peptide corresponding to amino acids 54-75 of the mouse p19(Arf) protein reacted with the native protein expressed in mammalian cells. Neither antibody detected human or golden hamster Arf proteins. The two antibodies, both of IgG2b isotype, are directed to adjacent epitopes contained within residues 54-62 and 62-75, respectively, of the mouse p19(Arf) protein, and both were highly efficient in detecting p19(Arf) by immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence. One antibody proved useful for immunohistochemical staining of p19(Arf) in fixed sections of mouse testes, revealing low levels of protein expression within the nucleoli of spermatogonia. This indicates that these antibodies should be useful in detecting the endogenous p(19Arf) protein at specific stages of mouse development and during early stages of tumorigenesis.",

    "abstract": "The tumor suppressor gene p53 has an apparent role in breast tumor development in humans, as approximately 30% of sporadic tumors acquire p53 mutations and Li-Fraumeni syndrome patients carrying germ line p53 mutations frequently develop breast tumors at early age. In the present study, conditional expression of a targeted mutation is used to analyze the role of the human R273H tumor-associated hotspot mutation in p53 in mammary gland tumorigenesis. Heterozygous p53(R270H/+)WAPCre mice (with mammary gland-specific expression of the p53.R270H mutation, equivalent to human R273H, at physiologic levels) develop mammary tumors at high frequency, indicating that the R270H mutation predisposes for mammary gland tumor development and acts in a dominant-negative manner in early stages of tumorigenesis. Spontaneous tumor development in these mice is further accelerated by 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) treatment at young age. The majority of spontaneous and DMBA-induced carcinomas and sarcomas from p53(R270H/+)WAPCre mice is estrogen receptor alpha positive, and expression profiles of genes also implicated in human breast cancer appear similarly altered. As such, p53(R270H/+)WAPCre mice provide a well-suited model system to study the role of p53 in breast tumorigenesis and the responsiveness of mammary gland tumors to chemotherapeutics.",

    "abstract": "We report a direct comparison of the differential effects of individual p53 mutations on lung tumor growth and progression, and the creation of a murine model of spontaneous advanced lung adenocarcinoma that closely recapitulates several aspects of advanced human pulmonary adenocarcinoma. We generated compound conditional knock-in mice with mutations in K-ras combined with one of three p53 alleles: a contact mutant, a structural mutant, or a null allele. p53 loss strongly promoted the progression of K-ras-induced lung adenocarcinomas, yielding a mouse model that is strikingly reminiscent of advanced human lung adenocarcinoma. The influence of p53 loss on malignant progression was observed as early as 6 weeks after tumor initiation. Furthermore, we found that the contact mutant p53R270H, but not the structural mutant p53R172H, acted in a partially dominant-negative fashion to promote K-ras-initiated lung adenocarcinomas. However, for both mutants, loss-of-heterozygosity occurred uniformly in advanced tumors, highlighting a residual tumor-suppressive function conferred by the remaining wild-type allele of p53. Finally, a subset of mice also developed sinonasal adenocarcinomas. In contrast to the lung tumors, expression of the point-mutant p53 alleles strongly promoted the development of sinonasal adenocarcinomas compared with simple loss-of-function, suggesting a tissue-specific gain-of-function.",

    "abstract": "The p53 tumor suppressor protein is a DNA sequence-specific transcriptional regulator that, in response to various forms of cellular stress, controls the expression of numerous genes involved in cellular outcomes including among others, cell cycle arrest and cell death. Two key features of the p53 protein are required for its transcriptional activities: its ability to recognize and bind specific DNA sequences and to recruit both general and specialized transcriptional co-regulators. In fact, multiple interactions with co-activators and co-repressors as well as with the components of the general transcriptional machinery allow p53 to either promote or inhibit transcription of different target genes. This review focuses on some of the salient features of the interactions of p53 with DNA and with factors that regulate transcription. We discuss as well the complexities of the functional domains of p53 with respect to these interactions.",

    "abstract": "Somatic mutations in exons encoding the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene are found in human lung adenocarcinomas and are associated with sensitivity to the tyrosine kinase inhibitors gefitinib and erlotinib. Nearly 90% of the EGFR mutations are either short, in-frame deletions in exon 19 or point mutations that result in substitution of arginine for leucine at amino acid 858 (L858R). To study further the role of these mutations in the initiation and maintenance of lung cancer, we have developed transgenic mice that express an exon 19 deletion mutant (EGFR(DeltaL747-S752)) or the L858R mutant (EGFR(L858R)) in type II pneumocytes under the control of doxycycline. Expression of either EGFR mutant leads to the development of lung adenocarcinomas. Two weeks after induction with doxycycline, mice that express the EGFR(L858R) allele show diffuse lung cancer highly reminiscent of human bronchioloalveolar carcinoma and later develop interspersed multifocal adenocarcinomas. In contrast, mice expressing EGFR(DeltaL747-S752) develop multifocal tumors embedded in normal lung parenchyma with a longer latency. With mice carrying either EGFR allele, withdrawal of doxycycline (to reduce expression of the transgene) or treatment with erlotinib (to inhibit kinase activity) causes rapid tumor regression, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging and histopathology, demonstrating that mutant EGFR is required for tumor maintenance. These models may be useful for developing improved therapies for patients with lung cancers bearing EGFR mutations.",

    "abstract": "The expression of the tumour suppressor gene p53 was analysed in 11 human breast cancer cell lines by immunohistochemistry, immunoprecipitation and cDNA sequencing. We used a panel of anti-p53 monoclonal antibodies for cell staining and found abnormalities in every case. Eight of the cell lines produce a form of p53 which can be immunoprecipitated by the monoclonal antibody PAb240 but not by PAb1620. In the murine system PAb240 only immunoprecipitates mutant p53. We sequenced p53 cDNA directly from four of the PAb240 positive cell lines using asymmetric PCR templates. All four contained missense mutations in p53 RNA, with no detectable expression of the wild type sequence. Different residues were affected in each cell line, but all the mutations changed amino acids conserved from man to Xenopus. These results imply that as in the murine system, the PAb240 antibody reliably detects a wide variety of p53 mutations and that these mutations have a common effect on the structure of p53. Immunohistochemical data suggest that p53 mutation is the commonest genetic alteration so far detected in primary breast cancer.",

In large, long-lived animals with substantial somatic regenerative capacity, such as vertebrates, p53 is an important tumour suppressor--an attribute thought to stem directly from its induction of death or arrest in mutant cells with damaged or unstable genomes. Chemotherapy and radiation exposure both induce widespread p53-dependent DNA damage. This triggers potentially lethal pathologies that are generally deemed an unfortunate but unavoidable consequence of the role p53 has in tumour suppression. Here we show, using a mouse model in which p53 status can be reversibly switched in vivo between functional and inactive states, that the p53-mediated pathological response to whole-body irradiation, a prototypical genotoxic carcinogen, is irrelevant for suppression of radiation-induced lymphoma. In contrast, delaying the restoration of p53 function until the acute radiation response has subsided abrogates all of the radiation-induced pathology yet preserves much of the protection from lymphoma. Such protection is absolutely dependent on p19(ARF)--a tumour suppressor induced not by DNA damage, but by oncogenic disruption of the cell cycle.",

We have designed BRaf(CA) mice to express normal BRaf prior to Cre-mediated recombination after which BRaf(VE) is expressed at physiological levels. BRaf(CA) mice infected with an Adenovirus expressing Cre recombinase developed benign lung tumors that only rarely progressed to adenocarcinoma. Moreover, BRaf(VE)-induced lung tumors were prevented by pharmacological inhibition of MEK1/2. BRaf(VE) expression initially induced proliferation that was followed by growth arrest bearing certain hallmarks of senescence. Consistent with Ink4a/Arf and TP53 tumor suppressor function, BRaf(VE) expression combined with mutation of either locus led to cancer progression.",

    "abstract": "Understanding the function of histone modifications across inducible genes in mammalian cells requires quantitative, comparative analysis of their fate during gene activation and identification of enzymes responsible. We produced high-resolution comparative maps of the distribution and dynamics of H3K4me3, H3K36me3, H3K79me2 and H3K9ac across c-fos and c-jun upon gene induction in murine fibroblasts. In unstimulated cells, continuous turnover of H3K9 acetylation occurs on all K4-trimethylated histone H3 tails; distribution of both modifications coincides across promoter and 5' part of the coding region. In contrast, K36- and K79-methylated H3 tails, which are not dynamically acetylated, are restricted to the coding regions of these genes. Upon stimulation, transcription-dependent increases in H3K4 and H3K36 trimethylation are seen across coding regions, peaking at 5' and 3' ends, respectively. Addressing molecular mechanisms involved, we find that Huntingtin-interacting protein HYPB/Setd2 is responsible for virtually all global and transcription-dependent H3K36 trimethylation, but not H3K36-mono- or dimethylation, in these cells. These studies reveal four distinct layers of histone modification across inducible mammalian genes and show that HYPB/Setd2 is responsible for H3K36 trimethylation throughout the mouse nucleus.",

    "abstract": "Mammalian lungs are branched networks containing thousands to millions of airways arrayed in intricate patterns that are crucial for respiration. How such trees are generated during development, and how the developmental patterning information is encoded, have long fascinated biologists and mathematicians. However, models have been limited by a lack of information on the normal sequence and pattern of branching events. Here we present the complete three-dimensional branching pattern and lineage of the mouse bronchial tree, reconstructed from an analysis of hundreds of developmental intermediates. The branching process is remarkably stereotyped and elegant: the tree is generated by three geometrically simple local modes of branching used in three different orders throughout the lung. We propose that each mode of branching is controlled by a genetically encoded subroutine, a series of local patterning and morphogenesis operations, which are themselves controlled by a more global master routine. We show that this hierarchical and modular programme is genetically tractable, and it is ideally suited to encoding and evolving the complex networks of the lung and other branched organs.",

    "abstract": "We have performed an extensive analysis of TP53 in 474 French families suggestive of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), including 232 families fulfilling the Chompret criteria. We identified a germline alteration of TP53 in 82 families (17%), in 67/232 of the families fulfilling the Chompret criteria (29%) and in 15/242 which did not fulfil these criteria (6%). Most of the alterations corresponded to missense mutations (67%), and we identified in four families genomic deletions removing the entire TP53 locus, the promoter and the non-coding exon 1, or exons 2-10. These results represent a definitive argument demonstrating that LFS results from TP53 haplodeficiency. The mean ages of tumour onset were significantly different between patients harbouring TP53 missense mutations and other types of alterations, missense mutations being associated with a 9 year earlier tumour onset. These results confirm that missense mutations not only inactivate p53 but also have an additional oncogenic effect. Germline alterations of TP53 that lead exclusively to loss of function are therefore associated with a later age of tumour onset and the presence of such mutations should be considered in atypical LFS families with tumours diagnosed after 40 years.",

    "abstract": "TGFbeta ligands act as tumor suppressors in early stage tumors but are paradoxically diverted into potent prometastatic factors in advanced cancers. The molecular nature of this switch remains enigmatic. Here, we show that TGFbeta-dependent cell migration, invasion and metastasis are empowered by mutant-p53 and opposed by p63. Mechanistically, TGFbeta acts in concert with oncogenic Ras and mutant-p53 to induce the assembly of a mutant-p53/p63 protein complex in which Smads serve as essential platforms. Within this ternary complex, p63 functions are antagonized. Downstream of p63, we identified two candidate metastasis suppressor genes associated with metastasis risk in a large cohort of breast cancer patients. Thus, two common oncogenic lesions, mutant-p53 and Ras, selected in early neoplasms to promote growth and survival, also prefigure a cellular set-up with particular metastasis proclivity by TGFbeta-dependent inhibition of p63 function.",

Conditional mouse models provide new opportunities for testing novel chemopreventatives, therapeutics and screening methods that are not possible with cultured cell lines or xenograft models. This protocol describes how to initiate tumors in two conditional genetic models of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using the activation of oncogenic K-ras alone or in combination with the loss of function of p53. We discuss methods for sporadic expression of Cre in the lungs through engineered adenovirus or lentivirus, and provide a detailed protocol for the administration of the virus by intranasal inhalation or intratracheal intubation. The protocol requires 1-5 min per mouse with an additional 30-45 min to set-up and allow for the recovery of mice from anesthesia. Mice may be analyzed for tumor formation and progression starting 2-3 weeks after infection.",

Abnormalities in p53 expression were found in 28 of 40 carcinomas, 14 of 17 squamous tumours showing abnormal p53 expression, whereas no expression of p53 was detectable in 7 carcinoid tumours or in 10 normal lung samples. Direct evidence for homozygous expression of mutant p53 mRNA in representative carcinomas was obtained by means of an asymmetric polymerase chain reaction mRNA sequencing strategy, which allowed sequencing without any cloning step. All the mutations were G to T transversions resulting in mis-sense mutations in aminoacids highly conserved in evolution. Mutation of the p53 gene is the most frequently identified genetic change in human lung cancer; these findings suggest that simple immunohistological methods can provide strong evidence of such mutation.",

    "abstract": "Thirty years ago p53 was discovered as a cellular partner of simian virus 40 large T-antigen, the oncoprotein of this tumour virus. The first decade of p53 research saw the cloning of p53 DNA and the realization that p53 is not an oncogene but a tumour suppressor that is very frequently mutated in human cancer. In the second decade of research, the function of p53 was uncovered: it is a transcription factor induced by stress, which can promote cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and senescence. In the third decade after its discovery new functions of this protein were revealed, including the regulation of metabolic pathways and cytokines that are required for embryo implantation. The fourth decade of research may see new p53-based drugs to treat cancer. What is next is anybody's guess.",

    "abstract": "Somatic mutations in the TP53 gene are one of the most frequent alterations in human cancers, and germline mutations are the underlying cause of Li-Fraumeni syndrome, which predisposes to a wide spectrum of early-onset cancers. Most mutations are single-base substitutions distributed throughout the coding sequence. Their diverse types and positions may inform on the nature of mutagenic mechanisms involved in cancer etiology. TP53 mutations are also potential prognostic and predictive markers, as well as targets for pharmacological intervention. All mutations found in human cancers are compiled in the IARC TP53 Database (http://www-p53.iarc.fr/). A human TP53 knockin mouse model (Hupki mouse) provides an experimental model to study mutagenesis in the context of a human TP53 sequence. Here, we summarize current knowledge on TP53 gene variations observed in human cancers and populations, and current clinical applications derived from this knowledge.",

    "abstract": "Non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, with an overall 5-year survival rate of only 10-15%. Deregulation of the Ras pathway is a frequent hallmark of NSCLC, often through mutations that directly activate Kras. p53 is also frequently inactivated in NSCLC and, because oncogenic Ras can be a potent trigger of p53 (ref. 3), it seems likely that oncogenic Ras signalling has a major and persistent role in driving the selection against p53. Hence, pharmacological restoration of p53 is an appealing therapeutic strategy for treating this disease. Here we model the probable therapeutic impact of p53 restoration in a spontaneously evolving mouse model of NSCLC initiated by sporadic oncogenic activation of endogenous Kras. Surprisingly, p53 restoration failed to induce significant regression of established tumours, although it did result in a significant decrease in the relative proportion of high-grade tumours. This is due to selective activation of p53 only in the more aggressive tumour cells within each tumour. Such selective activation of p53 correlates with marked upregulation in Ras signal intensity and induction of the oncogenic signalling sensor p19(ARF)( )(ref. 6). Our data indicate that p53-mediated tumour suppression is triggered only when oncogenic Ras signal flux exceeds a critical threshold. Importantly, the failure of low-level oncogenic Kras to engage p53 reveals inherent limits in the capacity of p53 to restrain early tumour evolution and in the efficacy of therapeutic p53 restoration to eradicate cancers.",

    "abstract": "Tumorigenesis is a multistep process that results from the sequential accumulation of mutations in key oncogene and tumour suppressor pathways. Personalized cancer therapy that is based on targeting these underlying genetic abnormalities presupposes that sustained inactivation of tumour suppressors and activation of oncogenes is essential in advanced cancers. Mutations in the p53 tumour-suppressor pathway are common in human cancer and significant efforts towards pharmaceutical reactivation of defective p53 pathways are underway. Here we show that restoration of p53 in established murine lung tumours leads to significant but incomplete tumour cell loss specifically in malignant adenocarcinomas, but not in adenomas. We define amplification of MAPK signalling as a critical determinant of malignant progression and also a stimulator of Arf tumour-suppressor expression. The response to p53 restoration in this context is critically dependent on the expression of Arf. We propose that p53 not only limits malignant progression by suppressing the acquisition of alterations that lead to tumour progression, but also, in the context of p53 restoration, responds to increased oncogenic signalling to mediate tumour regression. Our observations also underscore that the p53 pathway is not engaged by low levels of oncogene activity that are sufficient for early stages of lung tumour development. These data suggest that restoration of pathways important in tumour progression, as opposed to initiation, may lead to incomplete tumour regression due to the stage-heterogeneity of tumour cell populations.",

    "abstract": "The hallmarks of cancer comprise six biological capabilities acquired during the multistep development of human tumors. The hallmarks constitute an organizing principle for rationalizing the complexities of neoplastic disease. They include sustaining proliferative signaling, evading growth suppressors, resisting cell death, enabling replicative immortality, inducing angiogenesis, and activating invasion and metastasis. Underlying these hallmarks are genome instability, which generates the genetic diversity that expedites their acquisition, and inflammation, which fosters multiple hallmark functions. Conceptual progress in the last decade has added two emerging hallmarks of potential generality to this list-reprogramming of energy metabolism and evading immune destruction. In addition to cancer cells, tumors exhibit another dimension of complexity: they contain a repertoire of recruited, ostensibly normal cells that contribute to the acquisition of hallmark traits by creating the \"tumor microenvironment.\" Recognition of the widespread applicability of these concepts will increasingly affect the development of new means to treat human cancer.",

    "abstract": "There is presently great interest in mechanisms of acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors that are now being used widely in the treatment of a variety of common human cancers. To investigate these mechanisms, we established EGFR inhibitor-resistant clones from non-small cell lung cancer cells. A comparative analysis revealed that acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors was associated consistently with the loss of p53 and cross-resistance to radiation. To examine the role of p53, we first knocked down p53 in sensitive parental cells and found a reduction in sensitivity to both EGFR inhibitors and radiation. Conversely, restoration of functional p53 in EGFR inhibitor-resistant cells was sufficient to resensitize them to EGFR inhibitors or radiation in vitro and in vivo. Further studies indicate that p53 may enhance sensitivity to EGFR inhibitors and radiation via induction of cell-cycle arrest, apoptosis, and DNA damage repair. Taken together, these findings suggest a central role of p53 in the development of acquired resistance to EGFR inhibitors and prompt consideration to apply p53 restoration strategies in future clinical trials that combine EGFR inhibitors and radiation.",

    "abstract": "SV40 infection or transformation of murine cells stimulated the production of a 54K dalton protein that was specifically immunoprecipitated, along with SV40 large T and small t antigens, with sera from mice or hamsters bearing SV40-induced tumors. The same SV40 anti-T sera immunoprecipitated a 54K dalton protein from two different, uninfected murine embryonal carcinoma cell lines. These 54K proteins from SV40-transformed mouse cells and the uninfected embryonal carcinomas cells had identical partial peptide maps which were completely different from the partial peptide map of SV40 large T antigen. An Ad2+ND4-transformed hamster cell line also expressed a 54K protein that was specifically immunoprecipitated by SV40 T sera. The partial peptide maps of the mouse and hamster 54K protein were different, showing the host cell species specificity of these proteins. The 54K hamster protein was also unrelated to the Ad2+ND4 SV40 T antigen. Analogous proteins immunoprecipitated by SV40 T sera, ranging in molecular weight from 44K to 60K, were detected in human and monkey SV40-infected or -transformed cells. A wide variety of sera from hamsters and mice bearing SV40-induced tumors immunoprecipitated the 54K protein of SV40-transformed cells and murine embryonal carcinoma cells. Antibody produced by somatic cell hybrids between a B cell and a myeloma cell (hybridoma) against SV40 large T antigen also immunoprecipitated the 54K protein in virus-infected and -transformed cells, but did not do so in the embryonal carcinoma cell lines. We conclude that SV40 infection or transformation of mouse cells stimulates the synthesis or enhances the stability of a 54K protein. This protein appears to be associated with SV40 T antigen in SV40-infected and -transformed cells, and is co-immunoprecipitated by hybridomas sera to SV40 large T antigen. The 54K protein either shares antigenic determinants with SV40 T antigen or is itself immunogenic when in association with SV40 large T antigen. The protein varies with host cell species, and analogous proteins were observed in hamster,  monkey and human cells. The role of this protein in transformation is unclear at present.",

    "abstract": "BRAF mutations occur in 10-15% of colorectal cancers (CRCs) and confer adverse outcome. While RAF inhibitors such as vemurafenib (PLX4032) have proven effective in BRAF mutant melanoma, they are surprisingly ineffective in BRAF mutant CRCs, and the reason for this disparity remains unclear. Compared to BRAF mutant melanoma cells, BRAF mutant CRC cells were less sensitive to vemurafenib, and P-ERK suppression was not sustained in response to treatment. Although transient inhibition of phospho-ERK by vemurafenib was observed in CRC, rapid ERK re-activation occurred through EGFR-mediated activation of RAS and CRAF. BRAF mutant CRCs expressed higher levels of phospho-EGFR than BRAF mutant melanomas, suggesting that CRCs are specifically poised for EGFR-mediated resistance. Combined RAF and EGFR inhibition blocked reactivation of MAPK signaling in BRAF mutant CRC cells and markedly improved efficacy in vitro and in vivo. These findings support evaluation of combined RAF and EGFR inhibition in BRAF mutant CRC patients.",

    "abstract": "Tobacco use, primarily associated with cigarette smoking, is the largest preventable cause of cancer mortality, responsible for approximately one-third of all cancer deaths. Approximately 85% of lung cancers result from smoking, with an additional fraction caused by secondhand smoke exposure in nonsmokers. The risk of lung cancer is dose dependent, but can be dramatically reduced with tobacco cessation, especially if the person discontinues smoking early in life. The increase in lung cancer incidence in different countries around in the world parallels changes in cigarette consumption. Lung cancer risks are not reduced by switching to filters or low-tar/low-nicotine cigarettes. In patients with cancer, continued tobacco use after diagnosis is associated with poor therapeutic outcomes including increased treatment-related toxicity, increased risk of second primary cancer, decreased quality of life, and decreased survival. Tobacco cessation in patients with cancer may improve cancer treatment outcomes, but cessation support is often not provided by oncologists. Reducing the health related effects of tobacco requires coordinated efforts to reduce exposure to tobacco, accurately assess tobacco use in clinical settings, and increase access to tobacco cessation support. Lung cancer screening and coordinated international tobacco control efforts offer the promise to dramatically reduce lung cancer mortality in the coming decades. ",

    "abstract": "The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) has used the latest sequencing and analysis methods to identify somatic variants across thousands of tumours. Here we present data and analytical results for point mutations and small insertions/deletions from 3,281 tumours across 12 tumour types as part of the TCGA Pan-Cancer effort. We illustrate the distributions of mutation frequencies, types and contexts across tumour types, and establish their links to tissues of origin, environmental/carcinogen influences, and DNA repair defects. Using the integrated data sets, we identified 127 significantly mutated genes from well-known (for example, mitogen-activated protein kinase, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase, Wnt/β-catenin and receptor tyrosine kinase signalling pathways, and cell cycle control) and emerging (for example, histone, histone modification, splicing, metabolism and proteolysis) cellular processes in cancer. The average number of mutations in these significantly mutated genes varies across tumour types; most tumours have two to six, indicating that the number of driver mutations required during oncogenesis is relatively small. Mutations in transcriptional factors/regulators show tissue specificity, whereas histone modifiers are often mutated across several cancer types. Clinical association analysis identifies genes having a significant effect on survival, and investigations of mutations with respect to clonal/subclonal architecture delineate their temporal orders during tumorigenesis. Taken together, these results lay the groundwork for developing new diagnostics and individualizing cancer treatment. ",

    "abstract": "The key role of the p53 protein in tumor suppression is highlighted by its frequent mutation in human cancers and by the completely penetrant cancer predisposition of p53 null mice. Beyond providing definitive evidence for the critical function of p53 in tumor suppression, genetically engineered mouse models have offered numerous additional insights into p53 function. p53 knock-in mice expressing tumor-derived p53 mutants have revealed that these mutants display gain-of-function activities that actively promote carcinogenesis. The generation of p53 knock-in mutants with alterations in different domains of p53 has helped further elucidate the cellular and biochemical activities of p53 that are most fundamental for tumor suppression. In addition, modulation of p53 post-translational modification (PTM) status by generating p53 knock-in mouse strains with mutations in p53 PTM sites has revealed a subtlety and complexity to p53 regulation. Analyses of mouse models perturbing upstream regulators of p53 have solidified the notion that the p53 pathway can be compromised by means other than direct p53 mutation. Finally, switchable p53 models that allow p53 reactivation in tumors have helped evaluate the potential of p53 restoration therapy for cancer treatment. Collectively, mouse models have greatly enhanced our understanding of physiological p53 function and will continue to provide new biological and clinical insights in future investigations. ",

    "abstract": "Alveoli are gas-exchange sacs lined by squamous alveolar type (AT) 1 cells and cuboidal, surfactant-secreting AT2 cells. Classical studies suggested that AT1 arise from AT2 cells, but recent studies propose other sources. Here we use molecular markers, lineage tracing and clonal analysis to map alveolar progenitors throughout the mouse lifespan. We show that, during development, AT1 and AT2 cells arise directly from a bipotent progenitor, whereas after birth new AT1 cells derive from rare, self-renewing, long-lived, mature AT2 cells that produce slowly expanding clonal foci of alveolar renewal. This stem-cell function is broadly activated by AT1 injury, and AT2 self-renewal is selectively induced by EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) ligands in vitro and oncogenic Kras(G12D) in vivo, efficiently generating multifocal, clonal adenomas. Thus, there is a switch after birth, when AT2 cells function as stem cells that contribute to alveolar renewal, repair and cancer. We propose that local signals regulate AT2 stem-cell activity: a signal transduced by EGFR-KRAS controls self-renewal and is hijacked during oncogenesis, whereas another signal controls reprogramming to AT1 fate.

    "abstract": "Oncogenic mutations in the BRAF kinase occur in 6-8% of nonsmall cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), accounting for more than 90,000 deaths annually worldwide. The biological and clinical relevance of these BRAF mutations in NSCLC is incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate that human NSCLC cells with BRAF(V600E), but not other BRAF mutations, initially are sensitive to BRAF-inhibitor treatment. However, these BRAF(V600E) NSCLC cells rapidly acquire resistance to BRAF inhibition through at least one of two discrete molecular mechanisms: (i) loss of full-length BRAF(V600E) coupled with expression of an aberrant form of BRAF(V600E) that retains RAF pathway dependence or (ii) constitutive autocrine EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling driven by c-Jun-mediated EGFR ligand expression. BRAF(V600E) cells with EGFR-driven resistance are characterized by hyperphosphorylated protein kinase AKT, a biomarker we validated in BRAF inhibitor-resistant NSCLC clinical specimens. These data reveal the multifaceted molecular mechanisms by which NSCLCs establish and regulate BRAF oncogene dependence, provide insights into BRAF-EGFR signaling crosstalk, and uncover mechanism-based strategies to optimize clinical responses to BRAF oncogene inhibition.

    "abstract": "Much controversy surrounds the cell-of-origin of mutant K-Ras (K-RasG12D)-induced lung adenocarcinoma. To shed light on this issue, we have used technology that enables us to conditionally target K-RasG12D expression in Surfactant Protein C (SPC)(+) alveolar type 2 cells and in Clara cell antigen 10 (CC10)(+) Clara cells by use of cell-type-restricted recombinant Adeno-Cre viruses. Experiments were performed both in the presence and absence of the tumor suppressor gene p53, enabling us to assess what effect the cell-of-origin and the introduced genetic lesions have on the phenotypic characteristics of the resulting adenocarcinomas. We conclude that both SPC-expressing alveolar type 2 cells and CC10-expressing Clara cells have the ability to initiate malignant transformation following the introduction of these genetic alterations. The lungs of K-Ras(lox-Stop-lox-G12D/+) and K-Ras(lox-Stop-lox-G12D/+);tumor suppressor gene Trp53(F/F) mice infected with Adeno5-SPC-Cre and Adeno5-CC10-Cre viruses displayed differences in their tumor spectrum, indicating distinct cellular routes of tumor initiation. Moreover, using a multicolor Cre reporter line, we demonstrate that the resulting tumors arise from a clonal expansion of switched cells. Taken together, these results indicate that there are multiple cellular paths to K-RasG12D-induced adenocarcinoma and that the initiating cell influences the histopathological phenotype of the tumors that arise.

    "abstract": "Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is proposed as a cellular defense mechanism that restrains malignant progression of oncogene-expressing, initiated tumor cells. Consistent with this, expression of BRAF(V600E) in the mouse lung epithelium elicits benign tumors that fail to progress to cancer due to an apparent senescence-like proliferative arrest. Here we demonstrate that nuclear β-catenin → c-MYC signaling is essential for early stage proliferation of BRAF(V600E)-induced lung tumors and is inactivated in the subsequent senescence-like state. Furthermore, either β-catenin silencing or pharmacological blockade of Porcupine, an acyl-transferase essential for WNT ligand secretion and activity, significantly inhibited BRAF(V600E)-initiated lung tumorigenesis. Conversely, sustained activity of β-catenin or c-MYC significantly enhanced BRAF(V600E)-induced lung tumorigenesis and rescued the anti-tumor effects of Porcupine blockade. These data indicate that early stage BRAF(V600E)-induced lung tumors are WNT-dependent and suggest that inactivation of WNT → β-catenin → c-MYC signaling is a trigger for the senescence-like proliferative arrest that constrains the expansion and malignant progression of BRAF(V600E)-initiated lung tumors. Moreover, these data further suggest that the trigger for OIS in initiated BRAF(V600E)-expressing lung tumor cells is not simply a surfeit of signals from oncogenic BRAF but an insufficiency of WNT → β-catenin → c-MYC signaling. These data have implications for understanding how genetic abnormalities cooperate to initiate and promote lung carcinogenesis. ",

Biomedical investigators have since developed substantial understanding of the biology underlying the dependence of cancers on aberrant ERBB receptor signaling. An array of cancer-associated genetic alterations in ERBB receptors has also been identified. These findings have led to the discovery and development of mechanism-based therapies targeting ERBB receptors that have improved outcome for many cancer patients. In this Perspective, we discuss current paradigms of targeting ERBB receptors with cancer therapeutics and our understanding of mechanisms of action and resistance to these drugs. As current strategies still have limitations, we also discuss challenges and opportunities that lie ahead as basic scientists and clinical investigators work toward more breakthroughs. ",

    "abstract": "Missense mutations in the p53 tumor suppressor inactivate its antiproliferative properties but can also promote metastasis through a gain-of-function activity. We show that sustained expression of mutant p53 is required to maintain the prometastatic phenotype of a murine model of pancreatic cancer, a highly metastatic disease that frequently displays p53 mutations. Transcriptional profiling and functional screening identified the platelet-derived growth factor receptor b (PDGFRb) as both necessary and sufficient to mediate these effects. Mutant p53 induced PDGFRb through a cell-autonomous mechanism involving inhibition of a p73/NF-Y complex that represses PDGFRb expression in p53-deficient, noninvasive cells. Blocking PDGFRb signaling by RNA interference or by small molecule inhibitors prevented pancreatic cancer cell invasion in vitro and metastasis formation in vivo. Finally, high PDGFRb expression correlates with poor disease-free survival in pancreatic, colon, and ovarian cancer patients, implicating PDGFRb as a prognostic marker and possible target for attenuating metastasis in p53 mutant tumors.",

    "abstract": "The mammalian lung is a highly branched network in which the distal regions of the bronchial tree transform during development into a densely packed honeycomb of alveolar air sacs that mediate gas exchange. Although this transformation has been studied by marker expression analysis and fate-mapping, the mechanisms that control the progression of lung progenitors along distinct lineages into mature alveolar cell types are still incompletely known, in part because of the limited number of lineage markers and the effects of ensemble averaging in conventional transcriptome analysis experiments on cell populations. Here we show that single-cell transcriptome analysis circumvents these problems and enables direct measurement of the various cell types and hierarchies in the developing lung. We used microfluidic single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on 198 individual cells at four different stages encompassing alveolar differentiation to measure the transcriptional states which define the developmental and cellular hierarchy of the distal mouse lung epithelium. We empirically classified cells into distinct groups by using an unbiased genome-wide approach that did not require a priori knowledge of the underlying cell types or the previous purification of cell populations. The results confirmed the basic outlines of the classical model of epithelial cell-type diversity in the distal lung and led to the discovery of many previously unknown cell-type markers, including transcriptional regulators that discriminate between the different populations. We reconstructed the molecular steps during maturation of bipotential progenitors along both alveolar lineages and elucidated the full life cycle of the alveolar type 2 cell lineage. This single-cell genomics approach is applicable to any developing or mature tissue to robustly delineate molecularly distinct cell types, define progenitors and lineage hierarchies, and identify lineage-specific regulatory factors.

    "abstract": "The lung is a branched tubular network with two distinct compartments--the proximal conducting airways and the peripheral gas exchange region--separated by a discrete boundary termed the bronchoalveolar duct junction (BADJ). Here we image the developing mouse lung in three-dimensions (3D) and show that two nested developmental waves demarcate the BADJ under the control of a global hormonal signal. A first wave of branching morphogenesis progresses throughout embryonic development, generating branches for both compartments. A second wave of conducting airway differentiation follows the first wave but terminates earlier, specifying the proximal compartment and setting the BADJ. The second wave is terminated by a glucocorticoid signalling: premature activation or loss of glucocorticoid signalling causes a proximal or distal shift, respectively, in BADJ location. The results demonstrate a new mechanism of boundary formation in complex, 3D organs and provide new insights into glucocorticoid therapies for lung defects in premature birth.",

    "abstract": "Adenocarcinoma of the lung is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. Here we report molecular profiling of 230 resected lung adenocarcinomas using messenger RNA, microRNA and DNA sequencing integrated with copy number, methylation and proteomic analyses. High rates of somatic mutation were seen (mean 8.9 mutations per megabase). Eighteen genes were statistically significantly mutated, including RIT1 activating mutations and newly described loss-of-function MGA mutations which are mutually exclusive with focal MYC amplification. EGFR mutations were more frequent in female patients, whereas mutations in RBM10 were more common in males. Aberrations in NF1, MET, ERBB2 and RIT1 occurred in 13% of cases and were enriched in samples otherwise lacking an activated oncogene, suggesting a driver role for these events in certain tumours. DNA and mRNA sequence from the same tumour highlighted splicing alterations driven by somatic genomic changes, including exon 14 skipping in MET mRNA in 4% of cases. MAPK and PI(3)K pathway activity, when measured at the protein level, was explained by known mutations in only a fraction of cases, suggesting additional, unexplained mechanisms of pathway activation. These data establish a foundation for classification and further investigations of lung adenocarcinoma molecular pathogenesis. ",

    "abstract": "Recent genomic analyses of pathologically defined tumor types identify \"within-a-tissue\" disease subtypes. However, the extent to which genomic signatures are shared across tissues is still unclear. We performed an integrative analysis using five genome-wide platforms and one proteomic platform on 3,527 specimens from 12 cancer types, revealing a unified classification into 11 major subtypes. Five subtypes were nearly identical to their tissue-of-origin counterparts, but several distinct cancer types were found to converge into common subtypes. Lung squamous, head and neck, and a subset of bladder cancers coalesced into one subtype typified by TP53 alterations, TP63 amplifications, and high expression of immune and proliferation pathway genes. Of note, bladder cancers split into three pan-cancer subtypes. The multiplatform classification, while correlated with tissue-of-origin, provides independent information for predicting clinical outcomes. All data sets are available for data-mining from a unified resource to support further biological discoveries and insights into novel therapeutic strategies. ",

    "abstract": "Next-generation sequencing of human tumours has refined our understanding of the mutational processes operative in cancer initiation and progression, yet major questions remain regarding the factors that induce driver mutations and the processes that shape mutation selection during tumorigenesis. Here we performed whole-exome sequencing on adenomas from three mouse models of non-small-cell lung cancer, which were induced either by exposure to carcinogens (methyl-nitrosourea (MNU) and urethane) or by genetic activation of Kras (Kras(LA2)). Although the MNU-induced tumours carried exactly the same initiating mutation in Kras as seen in the Kras(LA2) model (G12D), MNU tumours had an average of 192 non-synonymous, somatic single-nucleotide variants, compared with only six in tumours from the Kras(LA2) model. By contrast, the Kras(LA2) tumours exhibited a significantly higher level of aneuploidy and copy number alterations compared with the carcinogen-induced tumours, suggesting that carcinogen-induced and genetically engineered models lead to tumour development through different routes. The wild-type allele of Kras has been shown to act as a tumour suppressor in mouse models of non-small-cell lung cancer. We demonstrate that urethane-induced tumours from wild-type mice carry mostly (94%) Kras Q61R mutations, whereas those from Kras heterozygous animals carry mostly (92%) Kras Q61L mutations, indicating a major role for germline Kras status in mutation selection during initiation. The exome-wide mutation spectra in carcinogen-induced tumours overwhelmingly display signatures of the initiating carcinogen, while adenocarcinomas acquire additional C > T mutations at CpG sites. These data provide a basis for understanding results from human tumour genome sequencing, which has identified two broad categories of tumours based on the relative frequency of single-nucleotide variations and copy number alterations, and underline the importance of carcinogen models for understanding the complex mutation spectra seen in human cancers.",

    "abstract": "Phosphatidylinositide 3' (PI3')-lipid signaling cooperates with oncogenic BRAF(V600E) to promote melanomagenesis. Sustained PI3'-lipid production commonly occurs via silencing of the PI3'-lipid phosphatase PTEN or, less commonly, through mutational activation of PIK3CA, encoding the 110-kDa catalytic subunit of PI3'-kinase-α (PI3Kα). To define the PI3K catalytic isoform dependency of BRAF-mutated melanoma, we used pharmacologic, isoform-selective PI3K inhibitors in conjunction with melanoma-derived cell lines and genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models. Although BRAF(V600E)/PIK3CA(H1047R) melanomas were sensitive to the antiproliferative effects of selective PI3Kα blockade, inhibition of BRAF(V600E)/PTEN(Null) melanoma proliferation required combined blockade of PI3Kα, PI3Kδ, and PI3Kγ, and was insensitive to PI3Kβ blockade. In GEM models, isoform-selective PI3K inhibition elicited cytostatic effects, but significantly potentiated melanoma regression in response to BRAF(V600E) pathway-targeted inhibition. Interestingly, PI3K inhibition forestalled the onset of MEK inhibitor resistance in two independent GEM models of BRAF(V600E)-driven melanoma. These results suggest that combination therapy with PI3K inhibitors may be a useful strategy to extend the duration of clinical response of patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma to BRAF(V600E) pathway-targeted therapies.",

    "abstract": "Lung carcinogenesis is a multistep process in which normal lung epithelial cells are converted to cancer cells through the sequential acquisition of multiple genetic or epigenetic events. Despite the utility of current genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models of lung cancer, most do not allow temporal dissociation of the cardinal events involved in lung tumor initiation and cancer progression. Here we describe a novel two-switch GEM model for BRAF(V600E)-induced lung carcinogenesis allowing temporal dissociation of these processes. In mice carrying a Flp recombinase-activated allele of Braf (Braf(FA)) in conjunction with Cre-regulated alleles of Trp53, Cdkn2a, or c-MYC, we demonstrate that secondary genetic events can promote bypass of the senescence-like proliferative arrest displayed by BRAF(V600E)-induced lung adenomas, leading to malignant progression. Moreover, restoring or activating TP53 in cultured BRAF(V600E)/TP53(Null) or BRAF(V600E)/INK4A-ARF(Null) lung cancer cells triggered a G1 cell-cycle arrest regardless of p19(ARF) status. Perhaps surprisingly, neither senescence nor apoptosis was observed upon TP53 restoration. Our results establish a central function for the TP53 pathway in restricting lung cancer development, highlighting the mechanisms that limit malignant progression of BRAF(V600E)-initiated tumors.",

    "abstract": "Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a genomically diverse, prevalent, and almost invariably fatal malignancy. Although conventional genetically engineered mouse models of human PDAC have been instrumental in understanding pancreatic cancer development, these models are much too labor-intensive, expensive, and slow to perform the extensive molecular analyses needed to adequately understand this disease. Here we demonstrate that retrograde pancreatic ductal injection of either adenoviral-Cre or lentiviral-Cre vectors allows titratable initiation of pancreatic neoplasias that progress into invasive and metastatic PDAC. To enable in vivo CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene inactivation in the pancreas, we generated a Cre-regulated Cas9 allele and lentiviral vectors that express Cre and a single-guide RNA. CRISPR-mediated targeting of Lkb1 in combination with oncogenic Kras expression led to selection for inactivating genomic alterations, absence of Lkb1 protein, and rapid tumor growth that phenocopied Cre-mediated genetic deletion of Lkb1. This method will transform our ability to rapidly interrogate gene function during the development of this recalcitrant cancer. ",

    "abstract": "KRAS-activating mutations drive human non-small cell lung cancer and initiate lung tumorigenesis in genetically engineered mouse (GEM) models. However, in a GEM model of KRAS(G12D)-induced lung cancer, tumors arise stochastically following a latency period, suggesting that additional events are required to promote early-stage tumorigenic expansion of KRAS(G12D)-mutated cells. PI3Kα (PIK3CA) is a direct effector of KRAS, but additional activation of PI3'-lipid signaling may be required to potentiate KRAS-driven lung tumorigenesis. Using GEM models, we tested whether PI3'-lipid signaling was limiting for the promotion of KRAS(G12D)-driven lung tumors by inducing the expression of KRAS(G12D) in the absence and presence of the activating PIK3CA(H1047R) mutation. PIK3CA(H1047R) expression alone failed to promote tumor formation, but dramatically enhanced tumorigenesis initiated by KRAS(G12D). We further observed that oncogenic cooperation between KRAS(G12D) and PIK3CA(H1047R) was accompanied by PI3Kα-mediated regulation of c-MYC, GSK3β, p27(KIP1), survivin, and components of the RB pathway, resulting in accelerated cell division of human or mouse lung cancer-derived cell lines. These data suggest that, although KRAS(G12D) may activate PI3Kα by direct biochemical mechanisms, PI3'-lipid signaling remains rate-limiting for the cell-cycle progression and expansion of early-stage KRAS(G12D)-initiated lung cells. Therefore, we provide a potential mechanistic rationale for the selection of KRAS and PIK3CA coactivating mutations in a number of human malignancies, with implications for the clinical deployment of PI3' kinase-targeted therapies.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the most frequent malignant neoplasm in most countries, and the main cancer-related cause of mortality worldwide in both sexes combined.The geographic and temporal patterns of lung cancer incidence, as well as lung cancer mortality, on a population level are chiefly determined by tobacco consumption, the main aetiological factor in lung carcinogenesis.Other factors such as genetic susceptibility, poor diet, occupational exposures and air pollution may act independently or in concert with tobacco smoking in shaping the descriptive epidemiology of lung cancer. Moreover, novel approaches in the classification of lung cancer based on molecular techniques have started to bring new insights to its aetiology, in particular among nonsmokers. Despite the success in delineation of tobacco smoking as the major risk factor for lung cancer, this highly preventable disease remains among the most common and most lethal cancers globally.Future preventive efforts and research need to focus on non-cigarette tobacco smoking products, as well as better understanding of risk factors underlying lung carcinogenesis in never-smokers.",

The IARC TP53 Database (http://p53.iarc.fr) is a popular resource that compiles occurrence and phenotype data on TP53 germline and somatic variations linked to human cancer. The deluge of data coming from cancer genomic studies generates new data on TP53 variations and attracts a growing number of database users for the interpretation of TP53 variants. Here, we present the current contents and functionalities of the IARC TP53 Database and perform a systematic analysis of TP53 somatic mutation data extracted from this database and from genomic data repositories. This analysis showed that IARC has more TP53 somatic mutation data than genomic repositories (29,000 vs. 4,000). However, the more complete screening achieved by genomic studies highlighted some overlooked facts about TP53 mutations, such as the presence of a significant number of mutations occurring outside the DNA-binding domain in specific cancer types. We also provide an update on TP53 inherited variants including the ones that should be considered as neutral frequent variations. We thus provide an update of current knowledge on TP53 variations in human cancer as well as inform users on the efficient use of the IARC TP53 Database.",

    "abstract": "The seventh edition of the non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) TNM staging system was developed by the International Association for the Staging of Lung Cancer (IASLC) Lung Cancer Staging Project by a coordinated international effort to develop data-derived TNM classifications with significant survival differences. Based on these TNM groupings, current 5-year survival estimates in NSLCC range from 73 % in stage IA disease to 13 % in stage IV disease. TNM stage remains the most important prognostic factor in predicting recurrence rates and survival times, followed by tumor histologic grade, and patient sex, age, and performance status. Molecular prognostication in lung cancer is an exploding area of research where interest has moved beyond TNM stage and into individualized genetic tumor analysis with immunohistochemistry, microarray, and mutation profiles. However, despite intense research efforts and countless publications, no molecular prognostic marker has been adopted into clinical use since most fail in subsequent cross-validation with few exceptions. The recent interest in immunotherapy for NSCLC has identified new biomarkers with early evidence that suggests that PD-L1 is a predictive marker of a good response to new immunotherapy drugs but a poor prognostic indicator of overall survival. Future prognostication of outcomes in NSCLC will likely be based on a combination of TNM stage and molecular tumor profiling and yield more precise, individualized survival estimates and treatment algorithms.

    "abstract": "Although it has become increasingly clear that cancers display extensive cellular heterogeneity, the spatial growth dynamics of genetically distinct clones within developing solid tumours remain poorly understood. Here we leverage mosaic analysis with double markers (MADM) to trace subclonal populations retaining or lacking p53 within oncogenic Kras-initiated lung and pancreatic tumours. In both models, p53 constrains progression to advanced adenocarcinomas. Comparison of lineage-related p53 knockout and wild-type clones reveals a minor role of p53 in suppressing cell expansion in lung adenomas. In contrast, p53 loss promotes both the initiation and expansion of low-grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanINs), likely through differential expression of the p53 regulator p19ARF. Strikingly, lineage-related cells are often dispersed in lung adenomas and PanINs, contrasting with more contiguous growth of advanced subclones. Together, these results support cancer type-specific suppressive roles of p53 in early tumour progression and offer insights into clonal growth patterns during tumour development.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Targeted therapy is beneficial in most cases, but the development of drug resistance stands as an obstacle to good prognosis. Multiple mechanisms were explored such as genetic alterations, activation of bypass signaling, and phenotypic transition. These intrinsic and/or extrinsic dynamic regulations facilitate tumor cell survival in meeting the demands of signaling under different stimulus. This review introduces lung cancer plasticity and heterogeneity and their correlation with drug resistance. While cancer plasticity and heterogeneity play an essential role in the development of drug resistance, the manipulation of them may bring some inspirations to cancer prognosis and treatment. That is to say, lung cancer plasticity and heterogeneity present us with not only challenges but also opportunities.",

    "abstract": "Tobacco smoking increases the risk of at least 17 classes of human cancer. We analyzed somatic mutations and DNA methylation in 5243 cancers of types for which tobacco smoking confers an elevated risk. Smoking is associated with increased mutation burdens of multiple distinct mutational signatures, which contribute to different extents in different cancers. One of these signatures, mainly found in cancers derived from tissues directly exposed to tobacco smoke, is attributable to misreplication of DNA damage caused by tobacco carcinogens. Others likely reflect indirect activation of DNA editing by APOBEC cytidine deaminases and of an endogenous clocklike mutational process. Smoking is associated with limited differences in methylation. The results are consistent with the proposition that smoking increases cancer risk by increasing the somatic mutation load, although direct evidence for this mechanism is lacking in some smoking-related cancer types.",

    "abstract": "Loss of the tumor suppressors RB1 and TP53 and MYC amplification are frequent oncogenic events in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). We show that Myc expression cooperates with Rb1 and Trp53 loss in the mouse lung to promote aggressive, highly metastatic tumors, that are initially sensitive to chemotherapy followed by relapse, similar to human SCLC. Importantly, MYC drives a neuroendocrine-low \"variant\" subset of SCLC with high NEUROD1 expression corresponding to transcriptional profiles of human SCLC. Targeted drug screening reveals that SCLC with high MYC expression is vulnerable to Aurora kinase inhibition, which, combined with chemotherapy, strongly suppresses tumor progression and increases survival. These data identify molecular features for patient stratification and uncover a potential targeted treatment approach for MYC-driven SCLC.",

Conventional genetically engineered mouse models enable the study of tumor growth in vivo, but they are neither readily scalable nor sufficiently quantitative to unravel the magnitude and mode of action of many tumor-suppressor genes. Here, we present a method that integrates tumor barcoding with ultradeep barcode sequencing (Tuba-seq) to interrogate tumor-suppressor function in mouse models of human cancer. Tuba-seq uncovers genotype-dependent distributions of tumor sizes. By combining Tuba-seq with multiplexed CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing, we quantified the effects of 11 tumor-suppressor pathways that are frequently altered in human lung adenocarcinoma. Tuba-seq enables the broad quantification of the function of tumor-suppressor genes with unprecedented resolution, parallelization, and precision.",

    "abstract": "TP53 mutations are the most frequent genetic alterations in breast cancer and are associated with more aggressive disease and worse overall survival. We have created two conditional mutant Trp53 alleles in the mouse that allow expression of Trp53R172H or Trp53R245W missense mutations in single cells surrounded by a normal stroma and immune system. Mice with Trp53 mutations in a few breast epithelial cells develop breast cancers with high similarity to human breast cancer including triple negative. p53R245W tumors are the most aggressive and exhibit metastases to lung and liver. Development of p53R172H breast tumors with some metastases requires additional hits. Sequencing of primary tumors and metastases shows p53R245W drives a parallel evolutionary pattern of metastases. These in vivo models most closely simulate the genesis of human breast cancer and will thus be invaluable in testing novel therapeutic options.",

    "abstract": "The major types of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC)-squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma-have distinct immune microenvironments. We developed a genetic model of squamous NSCLC on the basis of overexpression of the transcription factor Sox2, which specifies lung basal cell fate, and loss of the tumor suppressor Lkb1 (SL mice). SL tumors recapitulated gene-expression and immune-infiltrate features of human squamous NSCLC; such features included enrichment of tumor-associated neutrophils (TANs) and decreased expression of NKX2-1, a transcriptional regulator that specifies alveolar cell fate. In Kras-driven adenocarcinomas, mis-expression of Sox2 or loss of Nkx2-1 led to TAN recruitment. TAN recruitment involved SOX2-mediated production of the chemokine CXCL5. Deletion of Nkx2-1 in SL mice (SNL) revealed that NKX2-1 suppresses SOX2-driven squamous tumorigenesis by repressing adeno-to-squamous transdifferentiation. Depletion of TANs in SNL mice reduced squamous tumors, suggesting that TANs foster squamous cell fate. Thus, lineage-defining transcription factors determine the tumor immune microenvironment, which in turn might impact the nature of the tumor.",

    "abstract": "The evolutionarily conserved p53 protein and its cellular pathways mediate tumour suppression through an informed, regulated and integrated set of responses to environmental perturbations resulting in either cellular death or the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. The p53 and MDM2 proteins form a central hub in this pathway that receives stressful inputs via MDM2 and respond via p53 by informing and altering a great many other pathways and functions in the cell. The MDM2-p53 hub is one of the hubs most highly connected to other signalling pathways in the cell, and this may be why TP53 is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancers. Initial or truncal TP53 gene mutations (the first mutations in a stem cell) are selected for early in cancer development inectodermal and mesodermal-derived tissue-specific stem and progenitor cells and then, following additional mutations, produce tumours from those tissue types. In endodermal-derived tissue-specific stem or progenitor cells, TP53 mutations are functionally selected as late mutations transitioning the mutated cell into a malignant tumour. The order in which oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes are functionally selected for in a stem cell impacts the timing and development of a tumour.",

    "abstract": "KRAS mutations are the most frequent gain-of-function alterations in patients with lung adenocarcinoma (LADC) in the Western world. Although they have been identified decades ago, prior efforts to target KRAS signaling with single-agent therapeutic approaches such as farnesyl transferase inhibitors, prenylation inhibition, impairment of KRAS downstream signaling, and synthetic lethality screens have been unsuccessful. Moreover, the role of KRAS oncogene in LADC is still not fully understood, and its prognostic and predictive impact with regards to the standard of care therapy remains controversial. Of note, KRAS-related studies that included general non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) population instead of LADC patients should be very carefully evaluated. Recently, however, comprehensive genomic profiling and wide-spectrum analysis of other co-occurring genetic alterations have identified unique therapeutic vulnerabilities. Novel targeted agents such as the covalent KRAS G12C inhibitors or the recently proposed combinatory approaches are some examples which may allow a tailored treatment for LADC patients harboring KRAS mutations. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the therapeutic approaches of KRAS-mutated LADC and provides an update on the most recent advances in KRAS-targeted anti-cancer strategies, with a focus on potential clinical implications.",

    "abstract": "Tumor evolution from a single cell into a malignant, heterogeneous tissue remains poorly understood. Here, we profile single-cell transcriptomes of genetically engineered mouse lung tumors at seven stages, from pre-neoplastic hyperplasia to adenocarcinoma. The diversity of transcriptional states increases over time and is reproducible across tumors and mice. Cancer cells progressively adopt alternate lineage identities, computationally predicted to be mediated through a common transitional, high-plasticity cell state (HPCS). Accordingly, HPCS cells prospectively isolated from mouse tumors and human patient-derived xenografts display high capacity for differentiation and proliferation. The HPCS program is associated with poor survival across human cancers and demonstrates chemoresistance in mice. Our study reveals a central principle underpinning intra-tumoral heterogeneity and motivates therapeutic targeting of the HPCS.",

    "abstract": "Regulatory networks that maintain functional, differentiated cell states are often dysregulated in tumor development. Here, we use single-cell epigenomics to profile chromatin state transitions in a mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). We identify an epigenomic continuum representing loss of cellular identity and progression toward a metastatic state. We define co-accessible regulatory programs and infer key activating and repressive chromatin regulators of these cell states. Among these co-accessibility programs, we identify a pre-metastatic transition, characterized by activation of RUNX transcription factors, which mediates extracellular matrix remodeling to promote metastasis and is predictive of survival across human LUAD patients. Together, these results demonstrate the power of single-cell epigenomics to identify regulatory programs to uncover mechanisms and key biomarkers of tumor progression.",

    "abstract": "As one of the most common forms of cancer, lung cancers present as a collection of different histological subtypes. These subtypes are characterized by distinct sets of driver mutations and phenotypic appearance, and they often show varying degrees of heterogenicity, aggressiveness, and response/resistance to therapy. Intriguingly, lung cancers are also capable of showing features of multiple subtypes or converting from one subtype to another. The intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity of lung cancers as well as incidences of subtype transdifferentiation raise the question of to what extent the tumor characteristics are dictated by the cell of origin rather than the acquired driver lesions. We provide here an overview of the studies in experimental mouse models that try to address this question. These studies convincingly show that both the cell of origin and the genetic driver lesions play a critical role in shaping the phenotypes of lung tumors. However, they also illustrate that there is far from a direct one-to-one relationship between the cell of origin and the cancer subtype, as most epithelial cells can be reprogrammed toward diverse lung cancer fates when exposed to the appropriate set of driver mutations.",

    "abstract": "Lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer mortality, exhibits heterogeneity that enables adaptability, limits therapeutic success, and remains incompletely understood. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of metastatic lung cancer was performed using 49 clinical biopsies obtained from 30 patients before and during targeted therapy. Over 20,000 cancer and tumor microenvironment (TME) single-cell profiles exposed a rich and dynamic tumor ecosystem. scRNA-seq of cancer cells illuminated targetable oncogenes beyond those detected clinically. Cancer cells surviving therapy as residual disease (RD) expressed an alveolar-regenerative cell signature suggesting a therapy-induced primitive cell-state transition, whereas those present at on-therapy progressive disease (PD) upregulated kynurenine, plasminogen, and gap-junction pathways. Active T-lymphocytes and decreased macrophages were present at RD and immunosuppressive cell states characterized PD. Biological features revealed by scRNA-seq were biomarkers of clinical outcomes in independent cohorts. This study highlights how therapy-induced adaptation of the multi-cellular ecosystem of metastatic cancer shapes clinical outcomes.",

    "abstract": "The TP53 tumor suppressor is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancer. p53 suppresses tumorigenesis by transcriptionally regulating a network of target genes that play roles in various cellular processes. Though originally characterized as a critical regulator for responses to acute DNA damage (activation of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest), recent studies have highlighted new pathways and transcriptional targets downstream of p53 regulating genomic integrity, metabolism, redox biology, stemness, and non-cell autonomous signaling in tumor suppression. Here, we summarize our current understanding of p53-mediated tumor suppression, situating recent findings from mouse models and unbiased screens in the context of previous studies and arguing for the importance of the pleiotropic effects of the p53 transcriptional network in inhibiting cancer.",

    "abstract": "A search of the Cancer Family Registry of the National Cancer Institute revealed 24 kindreds with the syndrome of sarcoma, breast carcinoma, and other neoplasms in young patients. Cancer developed in an autosomal dominant pattern in 151 blood relatives, 119 (79%) of whom were affected before 45 years of age. These young patients had a total of 50 bone and soft tissue sarcomas of diverse histological subtypes and 28 breast cancers. Additional features of the syndrome included an excess of brain tumors (14 cases), leukemia (9 cases), and adrenocortical carcinoma (4 cases) before age 45 years. These neoplasms also accounted for 73% of the multiple primary cancers occurring in 15 family members. Six of these patients had second cancers linked to radiotherapy. The diversity of tumor types in this syndrome suggests pathogenetic mechanisms which differ from hereditary cancers arising in single organs or tissues. The syndrome is presently diagnosed on clinical grounds; laboratory markers are needed to identify high-risk individuals and families and to provide insights into susceptibility mechanisms that may be shared by a wide variety of cancers.",

    "abstract": "The hallmarks of cancer conceptualization is a heuristic tool for distilling the vast complexity of cancer phenotypes and genotypes into a provisional set of underlying principles. As knowledge of cancer mechanisms has progressed, other facets of the disease have emerged as potential refinements. Herein, the prospect is raised that phenotypic plasticity and disrupted differentiation is a discrete hallmark capability, and that nonmutational epigenetic reprogramming and polymorphic microbiomes both constitute distinctive enabling characteristics that facilitate the acquisition of hallmark capabilities. Additionally, senescent cells, of varying origins, may be added to the roster of functionally important cell types in the tumor microenvironment. SIGNIFICANCE: Cancer is daunting in the breadth and scope of its diversity, spanning genetics, cell and tissue biology, pathology, and response to therapy. Ever more powerful experimental and computational tools and technologies are providing an avalanche of \"big data\" about the myriad manifestations of the diseases that cancer encompasses. The integrative concept embodied in the hallmarks of cancer is helping to distill this complexity into an increasingly logical science, and the provisional new dimensions presented in this perspective may add value to that endeavor, to more fully understand mechanisms of cancer development and malignant progression, and apply that knowledge to cancer medicine.",

    "abstract": "The advent of high-throughput sequencing has allowed to profoundly interrogate the molecular landscape of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the last years. These findings constitute the opportunity to better stratify these patients in order to address specific treatments to well-defined oncogene-restricted subgroups. Among them, BRAF-mutated lung cancers represent around 4% of NSCLC, thus identifying a clinically relevant population that should be aptly managed. Pivotal phase II trials have demonstrated the efficacy of combinatorial treatment - dabrafenib plus trametinib, targeting both BRAF and MEK - for patients harboring V600E mutations, making this specific BRAF alteration a mandatory requirement in the genetic portrait of advanced non-squamous lung cancer patients. However, around half of BRAF+ NSCLC patients remain orphan of targeted approaches. Here we review the available evidence, mainly from a clinical perspective, of therapeutic strategies for both V600E and non-V600 patients, in terms of small molecule, immune checkpoint inhibitors and forthcoming integrated strategies. Looking at on-going clinical trials, a special attention is dedicated to emergent molecules and combinatorial strategies that not only will improve outcomes of classical V600E, but also will make concrete the chance of tailored treatments for the majority of BRAF-mutated patients.",

    "abstract": "In a closed colony of approximately one million mice which had been rigidly pedigreed (brother to sister) from a few original mice, three unusual mice have appeared. These three have obviously deviated from what would be expected according to the accepted laws of inbreeding geneity. Thus three unexpected incidences of increased variability have occurred three times in addition to the occasional appearance of new mutations (approximately one in 26,000 mice). The first mouse developed a sudden increase in susceptibility to spontaneous tumors of mammary origin. She became the mother of the well-known C family used extensively in cancer research. The second mouse clearly exhibited, among clear-cut altered biological characteristics, several somatic mutations, thus indicating an unstable genetic condition. The third mouse developed a highly significant capacity to regress and eliminate spontaneous tumor tissue. The conclusion is reached that unstable biological states arise occasionally during the process of inbreeding.",

    "abstract": "The development of cisplatin-based induction chemotherapy followed by surgical resection or radiation has improved the poor prognosis of stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In vitro studies indicate that p53 can modulate cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity, but the molecular genetic features determining response or resistance to cisplatin in vivo must be defined. For this reason, tumor specimens from 52 patients with stage IIIA NSCLC entered in a prospective clinical trial of cisplatin-based induction chemotherapy followed by surgical resection were examined for p53 expression by immunohistochemical staining before and after induction chemotherapy. p53 expression was correlated with clinical and pathological response using Fisher's exact test. No correlation was established between p53 expression and clinical response because 47 of the 52 patients studied had a major response. However, a significant association was observed between aberrant p53 expression and resistance to chemotherapy as assessed by pathological response. Only 3 of the 20 patients whose tumors exhibited a high level (+ + to + + + +) of p53 staining experienced a major (+ + + to + + + +) pathological response to chemotherapy. Only 7 of 52 cases examined before and after chemotherapy treatment exhibited a change in the level of p53 expression after cisplatin-based chemotherapy. These results indicate that cisplatin alters p53 expression infrequently and suggest a direct link between aberrant p53 expression and resistance to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in NSCLC.",

    "abstract": "Mice constitutively lacking alleles of the p53 tumour suppressor gene spontaneously develop lymphomas and sarcomas. We report here that a single dose of 4 Gy radiation dramatically decreases the latency for tumour development in p53 heterozygous mice. The pattern of genetic alterations at the remaining wild type allele in these tumours differs substantially from spontaneous tumours from similar mice indicating that p53 itself may have been a target for radiation-induced alterations. Lower dose irradiation (1 Gy) of preweanling p53 null mice also significantly decreases tumour latency, suggesting that there are additional genetic targets involved in radiation-induced malignancy. Thus p53-deficient mice provide a sensitive model system for studies of the consequences of radiation exposure.",

    "abstract": "The ability of p53 to activate transcription from specific sequences suggests that genes induced by p53 may mediate its biological role as a tumor suppressor. Using a subtractive hybridization approach, we identified a gene, named WAF1, whose induction was associated with wild-type but not mutant p53 gene expression in a human brain tumor cell line. The WAF1 gene was localized to chromosome 6p21.2, and its sequence, structure, and activation by p53 was conserved in rodents. Introduction of WAF1 cDNA suppressed the growth of human brain, lung, and colon tumor cells in culture. Using a yeast enhancer trap, a p53-binding site was identified 2.4 kb upstream of WAF1 coding sequences. The WAF1 promoter, including this p53-binding site, conferred p53-dependent inducibility upon a heterologous reporter gene. These studies define a gene whose expression is directly induced by p53 and that could be an important mediator of p53-dependent tumor growth suppression.",

    "abstract": "Irradiation of mammalian cells with UV light results in a dose-dependent accumulation of the p53 tumor-suppressor gene product that is evident within 2 hr. UV treatment causes a dramatic increase in p53-specific transcriptional transactivation activity and an increase in expression of the p53-responsive gene mdm-2. UV-stimulated mdm-2 expression is not directly correlated with the level of p53 protein in a cell because mdm-2 induction is delayed at high UV doses even though p53 levels rise almost immediately. Cells lacking p53 protein do not respond to UV by increasing their expression of mdm-2. The delayed induction of mdm-2 at high UV doses suggests that, in addition to p53 protein levels, other factors contribute to the regulation of mdm-2 expression following UV treatment. The time of induction of mdm-2 in cells treated with UV light correlates with recovery of normal rates of DNA synthesis, presumably after DNA repair. These data indicate a possible role for mdm-2 in cell cycle progression.",

The mdm-2 gene is shown here to contain a p53 DNA-binding site and a genetically responsive element such that expression of the mdm-2 gene can be regulated by the level of wild-type p53 protein. The mdm-2 protein, in turn, can complex with p53 and decrease its ability to act as a positive transcription factor at the mdm-2 gene-responsive element. In this way, the mdm-2 gene is autoregulated. The p53 protein regulates the mdm-2 gene at the level of transcription, and the mdm-2 protein regulates the p53 protein at the level of its activity. This creates a feedback loop that regulates both the activity of the p53 protein and the expression of the mdm-2 gene.",

    "abstract": "The oncogenes RAS and RAF came to view as agents of neoplastic transformation. However, in normal cells, these genes can have effects that run counter to oncogenic transformation, such as arrest of the cell division cycle, induction of cell differentiation, and apoptosis. Recent work has demonstrated that RAS elicits proliferative arrest and senescence in normal mouse and human fibroblasts. Because the Raf/MEK/MAP kinase signaling cascade is a key effector of signaling from Ras proteins, we examined the ability of conditionally active forms of Raf-1 to elicit cell cycle arrest and senescence in human cells. Activation of Raf-1 in nonimmortalized human lung fibroblasts (IMR-90) led to the prompt and irreversible arrest of cellular proliferation and the premature onset of senescence. Concomitant with the onset of cell cycle arrest, we observed the induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p21(Cip1) and p16(Ink4a). Ablation of p53 and p21(Cip1) expression by use of the E6 oncoprotein of HPV16 demonstrated that expression of these proteins was not required for Raf-induced cell cycle arrest or senescence. Furthermore, cell cycle arrest and senescence were elicited in IMR-90 cells by the ectopic expression of p16(Ink4a) alone. Pharmacological inhibition of the Raf/MEK/MAP kinase cascade prevented Raf from inducing p16(Ink4a) and also prevented Raf-induced senescence. We conclude that the kinase cascade initiated by Raf can regulate the expression of p16(Ink4a) and the proliferative arrest and senescence that follows. Induction of senescence may provide a defense against neoplastic transformation when the MAP kinase signaling cascade is inappropriately active.",
